```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(billboard)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- wiki_hot_100s |>
  as_tibble() |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

> Which artist appears the most times?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Some artist appear differently at different times
temp <- x |> 
  group_by(artist) |> 
  summarise(appearences = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(appearences))
temp|>
  slice(1:10)
```
`r temp$artist[1]` appears the most! 

> How many artists appear only once?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
temp2 <- temp |>
  filter(appearences == 1)
  temp2
```

A total of `r nrow(temp2)` artists appear only once in the Billboard Top 100 from `r min(x$year)` to `r max(x$year)`.


> Which year features the most distinct artists? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
temp3 <- x |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  distinct(artist) |> 
  summarise(uniq = n()) |> 
  arrange(uniq)
temp3 |>
  slice(1:5)
```
`r temp3$year[1]` features `r temp3$uniq[1]` unique artists. Nice, this is by far the most of any year!
